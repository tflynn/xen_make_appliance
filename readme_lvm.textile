h1. Introduction

p. These notes detail the LVM setup used by the accompanying *xen_make_appliance* script. They represent a full Centos 5 LVM setup from scratch. No doubt more elegant solutions exist.

p.  If you find some component is missing, use 'sudo yum -y install [component]' to install it.

h1. Disk configuration used

p. The setup described below applies to a configuration with five identical 1GB SATA disks - /dev/sdb through /dev/sdf
    
p  The disk image for a VM is a logical volume that's striped across the five physical disks.</p>
    
h1. Partitioning the disks

p. Use <strong><code>/sbin/parted</code></strong> not <code>/sbin/fdisk</code>

p. For each disk - /dev/sdb through /dev/sdf

<pre>
# Create a basic partition - DOS style
sudo parted -s /dev/sdb mklabel msdos
# Partition the entire disk as a single primary partition
sudo parted -s /dev/sdb mkpart primary 0 1000000
</pre>

h1. Create an LVM physical disk

<pre>
# Create an LVM physical disk from the entire primary partition
sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1
</pre>
<h1>Create an LVM volume group</h1>
<p>When all of the LVM physical disks have been created:</p>
<pre>
# Combine all the LVM physical disks into a single LVM volume group 'vms'
sudo vgcreate vms /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1 /dev/sdf1
</pre>
